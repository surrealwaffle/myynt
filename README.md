A description usage will be added soon. See [TASKS.md](https://github.com/surrealwaffle/myynt/blob/master/TASKS.md) for a list of tasks to get done.
This project will be written for C++17 and depend on *yymp*, a metaprogramming library I developed.

The feasible features I desired have been implemented to a usable state, but testing needs to be done.
